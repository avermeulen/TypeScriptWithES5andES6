# TypeScript with ES5 and ES6 in the project

Create a separate `backend` and `frontend` folder seems to work will. The backend folder compiles to `ES6` and the frontend one to `ES5`.

This is working with `atom-typescript` currently.

## Install

`
npm install
npm run start     
`

It assumes you have TypeScript installed.

If not do `npm install -g tsc`.
